    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>Welcome to my homepage about me! My name is <strong>Ryan Eldred-Neville</strong> and I am 18 years old. I was born and raised in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Some things I like are animals, visual arts, the gym, music and more. I have 3 pets, which consists of my dog <em>Nova</em> and my 2 cats; <em>Cinder</em> and <em>Elliot</em>.</p>
        
    <p>I am currently a student enrolled in a 2 year <em>Interactive Media Design</em> program at Algonquin college. I hope to improve my skills in videography, photography, coding, graphic design and more!</p>

    <p>Once I graduate after my 2<sup>nd</sup> year in college is done, I want to find a job that involves these skills that are covered in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>. As well as getting hired at a job that interests me, I want to keep my hobbies up as well, which means continuing to go to the gym and other stuff.</p>
